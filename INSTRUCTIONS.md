The program should be running and you should see a folder appear that is named “Google Photos Library”. In the command prompt window, you will see the the downloads happening. The program will close when everything is downloaded. Keep in mind, Google has limits on their API which most likely won’t be reached. You can only download 75,000 media items per day. The download process may take a long time depending on how big your media library is. My library was about 6000 photos and videos and it took about 1-2 hrs.
